    "\n",
    "Every time you train a model and then test it on some ***unseen data***, you're going to get ***prediction errors***.\n",
    "\n",
    "These errors can be ***decomposed*** into three distinct terms: ***bias***, ***variance*** and ***noise***.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the last term: ***noise***. This is the ***irreducible*** part of the error. Data is ***noisy***. Sometimes the noise can be cleaned up (removing outliers, for instance), but more often than not, there will be a level of noise you simply cannot get rid of.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we cannot do much about the noise, let's check the other two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ***Bias***: \n",
    "\n",
    "    1.1 If a model has high ***bias***, it means it is ***consistently*** either ***under-*** or ***over-*** shooting the actual values (on unseen data!)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.2 This is due to ***wrong assumptions*** about the model, i.e., the model is ***too simple*** to represent the data - like ***fitting a line*** to ***quadratic data***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.3 ***High Bias*** is usually a sign of a model ***underfitting*** the training data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.4 If you add ***more data*** and retrain the model, its coefficients ***do not change much***.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.5 ***IMPORTANT: DO NOT*** confuse this bias with the ***bias term (b0)*** from a linear model!\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. ***Variance***: \n",
    "\n",
    "    2.1 If a model has high ***variance***, it means it is ***too sensitive*** to variations in the training data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.2 This is due to a ***too complex*** model - it is fitting the noisy data too good!\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.3 ***High Variance*** is usually a sign of a model ***overfitting*** the training data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    2.4 If you add ***more data*** and retrain the models, its coefficients are likely ***changing a lot***.\n",
