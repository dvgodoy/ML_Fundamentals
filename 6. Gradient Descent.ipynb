    "## 1. Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent is a generic optimization algorithm used to find optimal solutions (maximum or minimum). It can be used to minimize a given cost function of a Machine Learning algorithm, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by tweaking a set of parameters, performing incremental changes to them at every step, gradually converging to the solution (or not!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key is the ***incremental changes*** of the parameters. How does it know if it should ***increase*** or ***decrease*** a given parameter? How does it know ***how much*** to change?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the ***partial derivative*** is used for. It determines how much the ***cost function changes*** if  ***one parameter changes a little bit***. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to know ***how much*** $J(w_1, w_2) \\\\ $ ***changes*** when we ***modify*** the value of $w_1 \\ $ ***a bit***, we have the ***partial derivative of*** $J(w_1, w_2) \\\\ $ ***with respect to*** $w_1 \\ $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{J(w_1, w_2)}}{\\partial{w_1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The same holds for $w_2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial{J(w_1, w_2)}}{\\partial{w_2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, ***gradient descent*** will compute ***partial derivatives with respect to every weight*** (and the ***bias*** too!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it will ***update each weight*** using its corresponding ***partial derivative*** and a ***multiplying factor*** $\\eta$ which is known as the ***learning rate***.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_1 = w_1 - \\eta \\frac{\\partial{J(w_1, w_2)}}{\\partial{w_1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***IMPORTANT***:\n",
    "   - The ***learning rate*** is the ***single most important hyper-parameter*** to tune when you are using ***Deep Learning*** models! \n",
    "   - If it is ***too small***, convergence to the solution will be ***extremely slow***, but if it is ***too big***, you may end up ***not converging at all***. You will understand these mechanisms in the ***interactive example*** and the ***experiment***.\n",

    "<center>Source: CS231n CNN for Visual Recognition</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "After ***updating all weights***, it restarts the process, ***re-evaluating the partial derivatives using the updated weights*** and ***updating all weights one more time***, and so on and so forth!\n",
    "\n",
    "That is just it! No rocket science, it is quite simple, actually!\n",
    "\n",
    "But ***partial derivatives*** can be a bit intimidating, so let's go through an interactive example!"

    "It uses ***all data points*** to compute the partial derivatives and, therefore, its path towards the solution is stable, yet it is going to be ***very slow*** on large datasets.\n",

    "It uses a ***single data point*** to compute the partial derivative and, because of it, it is ***very fast***, but its path towards the solution is going to be ***erratic*** and ***jumpy***.\n",

    "It uses ***some data points*** to compute the partial derivative and it is a compromise between ***stability*** and ***speed***. Its size is a ***hyper-parameter*** on its own, although a value of 32 (and other powers of 2) are commonly used."

    "    - keeping ***maximum batch size***, increase ***learning rate*** to 0.000562 (three notches) - what happens to the trajectory? Why?\n",
